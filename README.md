# Cow_Says_Moo_Backend
PRISMS house event website's backend code (javascript)

Currently will not work what so ever, I've deleted the apiKey.

## setup

- First check for node (run `node -v` to check if node exist)
- Then install Google API dependency: `npm install googleapis`, and firebase dependencies: `npm install firebase`

- There is a (hidden) secrets folder containing detailed information on OAuth2 and etc.

## How to run

- First launch a terminal at the root project location.
- Compile and execute the `main.js` file with `node main.js`.

## Current Program Structure

This part of the program will be integrated with the backend of svelte kit. Currently, it will only include auxiliary functions and classes with an assumption that we will have data. 
`main.js` is used mainly for testing purposes and will probably not exist when this is integrated into the larger website.
